<p><img src="/assets/olm_throughhole.png" alt="olm_throughhole">Todd and I spent a good deal of time yesterday figuring out the minimal viable version of the Open Lab Monitor (OLM) and putting it into a schematic.  We ended up choosing to emulate the very elegant and minimal design of the <a href="http://jeelabs.net/projects/hardware/wiki/JeeNode">JeeNode</a>, remove the JeeNode&#39;s radio (though wireless connectivity will soon be revisited!) and add ethernet connectivity.  Another important design decision was to select only through-hole components for the board: this will both facilitate our own learning process, and it also allows for the possibility of an easy-to-assemble kit for use in K-12 and university contexts.</p>

<p>So, what is the Open Lab Monitor?  It&#39;s essentially yet another take-off on the popular Arduino microcontroller platform, but tweaked slightly in order to make it easier to add peripherals that would be useful when making measurements in a scientific research context.  The main tweaks are the inclusion of some custom ports that can be connected to via some snug, cheap cables; our plan is to make a series of peripherals for this port interface that will allow for measuring temperature, humidity, moisture, pH, and do some simple electrochemistry.  The advantage of using an Arduino-based system is that doing so allows the user to connect to the incredible array of online tutorials that provide instructions for doing pretty much anything that a cheap microcontroller electronics platform allows; with minor modifications, the code from such projects should work on the Open Lab Monitor, as well.  We&#39;re also planning on designing a shield for the Raspberry Pi that would use the same custom connector interface, so that folks that would prefer to use the more powerful processor and operating system of the R-Pi can use the same inexpensive peripherals.  The decision as to whether to use an Arduino-based or R-Pi-based system is then mostly a matter of the user&#39;s comfort with the associated programming styles, as well as whether a low-power, battery-operated system is something they require (if so, then the Arduino is the way to go).</p>

<p>We&#39;re hoping to finalize this initial design in the next week or so, and make our first printed circuit boards soon.  Then we&#39;ll be in a better position to start designing the several peripherals we have in mind for this board.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the schematic as it stands now:</p>
