<p>We got our first batch of <a href="https://github.com/dwblair/open-lab-monitor">OLMs</a> in a few weeks ago -- but haven&#39;t yet had much time to play with them! Already, though, based on conversations about the applications we have in mind for these devices, we&#39;ve decided to change the pin arrangements on the &quot;OLM Connectors&quot; -- so that now we&#39;ll be providing both SPI and I2C connections, as well as a directy VIN connection (to whatever power source is powering the board).</p>

<p><a href="/assets/arrival5.5.jpg"><img width = 300 src = "/assets/arrival5.5.jpg"/></a></p>

<p>This new design fits nicely in a small, inexpensive plastic case from SERPAC.  Our plan over the next few weeks is to design a simple &quot;ambient temp and humidity and probe temp&quot; peripheral that will connect to the OLM main board via a ribbon cable, and to figure out what sorts of modifications to the SERPAC case will be required in order to allow for a nice, initial temperature-monitoring prototype.</p>

<p><strong>Open-log</strong>.  Meanwhile, on the software front, we&#39;ve initiated an &quot;open data logging&quot; project we&#39;re calling &quot;<a href="http://open-log.pvos.org/">open-log</a>&quot;.  It&#39;s based on <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a>, and is very crude at this point (baby steps!), but we have plans to implement an server-based logging platform based on numpy, matplotlib, D3, and PyTables.  Feel free to <a href="https://github.com/dwblair/open-log">check out the code on github</a> -- fork away!</p>

<a href="/">Pioneer Valley Open Science</a> is a group that formed in Amherst, MA in order to develop scientific projects that are accessible, open, and good for the world. We're greatly inspired by (and attempt to contribute to) <a href="http://publiclab.org">The Public Laboratory for Open Technology and Science</a>. You can reach us at info @ pvos.org.
